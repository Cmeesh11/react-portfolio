# React Portfolio

## Description

*Note: This will not be my official portfolio. My official portfolio is pinned on my github profile.*
This is a portfolio application using React that renders different page components based on which one is clicked. It contains an about me section, porfolio section, contact page, and my resume.

## Usage

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to select the tab that you would like to see displayed. If you click on the project images, you will be redirected to the respective github repository.
